# HALO

HALO is a cluster management system designed for managing Lustre HA and similar use cases.
HALO was previously known as GoLustre, and only supported Lustre HA, but now it can manage other cluster types.

LANL software release number: O4905.

## Documentation

This README has a high-level overview.

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs/` directory, in the [typst](https://typst.app/) markup format.
To compile the documentation into PDFs, run:
```bash

### Man Pages

The source for the halo man pages are in `docs/man`.

## Quick Start - Simulating a Cluster Locally

HALO normally runs on a cluster of filesystem servers, but it is possible to run it locally on a laptop or VM to test it out.
Rather than running each server process on a separate node, all processes can run on the same node, communicating with each other over the localhost interface.

The instructions below simulate a simple single-node file server without failover. I recommend running each process in a separate tmux pane.

See the [Test Environment](docs/developer_guide.typ#L357) section in the developer guide for more detailed
information on how to simulate a more complicated cluster with failover.

1. Start the remote service, giving it an ID of `test_agent` (the test ID is used to control its resources in the test environment):

```bash
cargo run --bin halo_remote -- --network 127.0.0.0/24 --port 8000  --test-id test_agent --ocf-root tests/ocf_resources/
```

2. Start the manager service, using `--manage-resources` to tell it to actively manage resources:

```bash
cargo run --bin halo_manager -- --config tests/simple.yaml --socket halo.socket  --statefile halo.state --manage-resources
```

You should see it output information about updating the state of resources.

The test environment uses the existence of empty files as a sign that a resource is "running".
Look in the halo directory for files named `test_agent.*` -- these are created when the test agent "starts" a resource.

3. Run the `status` command:

```bash
cargo run --bin halo -- status --socket halo.socket
```
This outputs information on the state of the resources at the current moment:

```
test_zpool      (heartbeat/ZFS):        Running on 127.0.0.1
test_ost        (lustre/Lustre):        Running on 127.0.0.1
test_mgt        (lustre/Lustre):        Running on 127.0.0.1
test_mdt        (lustre/Lustre):        Running on 127.0.0.1
Connected hosts:        127.0.0.1
Disconnected hosts:
```

4. Try "stopping" a resource by removing its state file:

```bash
rm test_agent.lustre._mnt_test_ost
```

You should see the manager process output status changes as it notices the resource is stopped, and then starts the resource. Try running the monitor command quickly multiple times as the resource state changes, to see if you can catch it in various states.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Architecture

HALO consists of two services: a management service that runs on the cluster master node, and a remote service that runs on Lustre servers.
The management service has the logic on where and when to start/stop resources. The remote service is "dumb" and only responds to commands from the manager.
The operator uses the CLI to interact with the management service on the master node.

### Management Service

The management service uses the `halo_manager` binary. The entry point is in `src/bin/manager.rs`, and the functionality is in `src/manager.rs`.

The manager launches two threads of control.

- The first is a server, launched in `src/manager.rs:server_main()` which listens for commands from the command line utility, and responds to them.

- The second is the actual manager process, launched in `src/manager.rs:manager_main()`, which periodically launches monitor commands to the remote services to monitor the status of the resources that they host.

### Remote Service
The remote service uses the `halo_remote` binary. The entry point is in `src/bin/remote.rs` and the functionality is in `src/remote/*.rs`. 

The remote agent runs a capnp RPC server whose main loop is in `src/remote/mod.rs:__agent_main()`. The agent listens for requests from the manager and acts on them.
The requests are to stop, start, or monitor a resource.
Which resource to act on is determined by the arguments passed in the request from the manager.
The arguments determine the location of the OCF Resource Agent script that is used to actually process the requests.

## Installation

To install and start the management server:
```bash
# cp systemd/halo.service /lib/systemd/system/
# cp target/debug/halo_manager /usr/local/sbin/
# cp target/debug/halo /usr/local/sbin/
# systemctl start halo.service
```

To install and start the remote server:
```bash
# clush -g mds,oss --copy systemd/halo-remote.service --dest /lib/systemd/system/
# clush -g mds,oss --copy target/debug/halo_remote --dest /usr/local/sbin/
# systemctl start halo-remote.service
```

## Configuration

Besides using command-line arguments,
the daemons can be configured via environment variables defined in `/etc/sysconfig/halo`.
HALO recognizes the following variables:

- `HALO_CONFIG` -- defines the location to search for the configuration file (default: `/etc/halo/halo.conf`).
- `HALO_PORT` -- defines port for the daemon to listen on (default `8000`).
- `HALO_NET` -- defines the network that the daemon listens on (default `192.168.1.0/24`).
- `HALO_LOG` -- the log level for the manager and remote daemons. Default is "warn". Set to "debug" or "trace" for more output.

When using TLS, HALO additionally will check `HALO_{CLIENT,SERVER}_{CERT,KEY}`.
